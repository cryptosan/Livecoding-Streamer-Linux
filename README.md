Livecoding Streamer For Linux
=========================

This software was forked from Twitch to Livecoding.
Thanks wargio :)
it's a good software !

## Why did i fork this software?
================================
I'm using Linux Mint 17 with Radeon graphic h/w.
but obsprojects's software didn't work on the OS, exactly, my h/w didn't support OpenGL 3.2+,
so i have to look for some softwares, and i got this software.

IF YOU CAN'T USE OBJPROJECTS'S PROGRAM, YOU SHOULD USE THIS.

all license is following wargio of Twitch-Streamer-Linux.
